## Features
- Zero-shot personality scoring from open-ended narratives (daily diaries / spontaneous thought).  
- Multi-model aggregation (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.) with deterministic seeding.  
- Alignment against standard inventories (IPIP-NEO-120) and profile-level analyses.  
- Utilities for prompt construction, score conversion, and result collation for paper figures/tables.
